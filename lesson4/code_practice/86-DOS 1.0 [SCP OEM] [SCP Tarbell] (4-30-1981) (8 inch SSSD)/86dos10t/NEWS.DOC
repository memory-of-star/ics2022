LATE NEWS AS OF APRIL 28, 1981

The file CPMTAB.ASM is the source file for the tables used by RDCPM and
is provided as an example of how new tables may be prepared. These
tables allow reading 8" or 5" single-density CP/M disks. If new tables
are desired for reading disks of a different CP/M 2 format, follow 
these steps:

	1. Prepare a source file of the new tables (see MAKRDCPM in
	   manual).

	2. Assemble the new tables.

	3. Convert the new tables to binary with HEX2BIN.

	4. Run MAKRDCPM.


The files INIT.ASM and INIT.COM are the source and object code for a
disk initialization routine. Any raw or blown disk may be formatted
by this routine to an empty disk with the soft-sector information
necessary for your controller. Note that CLEAR must be run after
formatting to use the disk with 86-DOS. The program prints a warning
message and asks which drive to format before initializing begins.

NOTE TO CROMEMCO USERS: You have two programs, INITLARG and INITSMAL.
Each may only be used with 8" and 5" drives, respectively.

NOTE TO TARBELL DOUBLE DENSITY USERS: You have two programs, INIT and
DINIT. INIT does a single density initialization on drives A to D.
DINIT does a double density initialization on drives A to D. Since
these are not normally double density drives, you may get an error
message after initialization is complete which can be ignored.
